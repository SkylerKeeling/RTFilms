The new film lets you explore the color spectrum like you never have before. Blue becomes green, green becomes purple, yellow becomes pink. Red tones stay red, which keeps skin colors natural in a sea of trippy tones. Aside from its remarkable color quality, the New LomoChrome Purple delivers vibrant photos with superb sharpness \u2014 and now with even finer grain than ever before! This new film also allows you to shoot in any weather condition and achieves breathtaking effects without using any special filters. Control the color changes in your photos by selecting different ISO settings. Green tones will become a shiny purple when you use an ISO 100 setting, but with an ISO 400 setting greens will instead become a darker indigo. Explore unlimited color creativity.
